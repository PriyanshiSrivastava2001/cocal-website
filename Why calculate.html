        <ul style="font-size:30px; font-family:cursive; font-weight: bold;">
        <li>The most useful part of a carbon footprint calculator is that you see all the surprising factors that contribute to the amount of energy you consume, because once you know what uses a lot of energy, you will know better how to reduce your footprint, and how to save yourself some cash too.</li>
        <li>Knowing your carbon footprint can let you plan on ways to focus on offsetting your carbon footprint, switching to a carbon neutral form of energy like wind or solar with a goal of being carbon neutral.</li>
        <li>Calculating your carbon footprint on an annual or even quarterly basis can help you engage with how you are consuming resources and make adjustments, big and small, that help keep us sustainable.</li>
